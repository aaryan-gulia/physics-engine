NEXT STEPS:
1. IMPLEMENT AABB OVERLAP CHECK BEFORE COLLISION RESOLUTION
2. FIND BETTER IMPLEMENTATION FOR 2D VEC IF POSSIBLE (Const/Dist + Len taking entire frametime)
4. IMPLEMENT MORE ENTITY TYPES: BOX AND AABBOX? : Do I need this? Can't I make everything out of circles?
6. ALLOW DELETING ENTITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
