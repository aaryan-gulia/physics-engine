NEXT STEPS:
1. IMPLEMENT AABB OVERLAP CHECK BEFORE COLLISION RESOLUTION : Done
2. FIND BETTER IMPLEMENTATION FOR 2D VEC IF POSSIBLE (Const/Dist + Len taking entire frametime) : Dne
3. IMPLEMENT MORE ENTITY TYPES: BOX AND AABBOX? : Do I need this? Can't I make everything out of circles?
4. ALLOW DELETING ENTITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
5. EXTEND SOA TO WORK WITH ALL CONSTRAINTS
6. OPTIMISE AND PARALLALISE THE BROAD PHASE GRID
7. NARROW PHASE COLLISION DETECTION and RESOLUTION
8. EXTEND SIMULATION TO ENABLE ANY CONVEX SHAPES
9. AABB overlap check before collision resultion causes bugs
